2. License Grant
Subject to your compliance with this EULA and payment of applicable fees (after the trial), Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software on a single machine associated with the hardware identifier used to generate your license.key.

The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights. No rights are granted by implication or otherwise except as expressly set forth in this EULA.

6. Activation, Licensing, and Updates
Licenses are fulfilled by authorized Distributors and are hardware-locked using the machine’s hardware identifier. Updates, if provided, are deemed part of the Software and subject to this EULA. Licensor may revoke or invalidate a license obtained through fraud or breach.

7. Support
Basic usage information may be provided. Installation and setup may be offered by Distributors. Licensor does not guarantee any particular response or resolution time.

LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS EULA OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSE (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

11. Termination
This EULA is effective until terminated. It will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any term. Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Software. Sections 4–5 and 8–13 shall survive termination.

12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
