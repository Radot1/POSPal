üìã Requirements
OS: Windows 10 or 11

Printer: 80mm thermal receipt printer (ESC/POS compatible)

Browser: A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on a device on the same local network (e.g., a tablet, laptop, or phone).

üöÄ Installation & Usage
Download: Go to the Releases page and download the latest POSPal release.

Unzip: Unzip the downloaded file to a permanent folder on your computer (e.g., C:\POSPal).

Run: Open the new folder and double-click POSPal.exe. The application will start silently in the background. No window will appear, which is normal.

Connect: On your tablet or any other device connected to the same Wi-Fi, open a web browser and go to http://<your-server-ip>:5000.

To find your server's IP address, open Command Prompt on the Windows machine, type ipconfig, and look for the "IPv4 Address".

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Before the first use, you must configure your printer and password.

After running POSPal.exe for the first time, a config.json file is created in the same folder.

Open this file with a text editor (like Notepad).

Change the printer_name value to the exact name of your printer as it appears in Windows' "Printers & scanners" settings.

It is highly recommended to change the default management_password to something secure.

{
    "printer_name": "Your Printer Name Here",
    "port": 5000,
    "management_password": "YourSecurePassword"
}

Save the file and restart POSPal.exe for the changes to take effect.

üõë How to Stop the Application
You can stop the application safely from the management interface.

On the main ordering screen, click the cog icon (<i class="fas fa-cog"></i>).

Enter your management password (the default is 9999).

Inside the management panel, click the red Shutdown button in the bottom-right corner.

Alternatively, you can close it using the Windows Task Manager:

Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager.

Go to the "Details" tab.

Find POSPal.exe in the list, select it, and click "End task".
