# POSPal Subscription Model Documentation

**Created**: September 2025  
**Last Updated**: September 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Business Model**: No Grace Period - Pay-to-Play

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

POSPal uses a **permanent license key system** with **immediate payment enforcement**. Each customer email gets one permanent license token that never changes, but subscription status controls access with no grace periods.

**Core Principle**: "Pay for what you use, use what you pay for"

---

## üîë **License Model**

### **Permanent License Keys**
- **One email = One permanent license token (forever)**
- License format: `POSPAL-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
- Tokens are **never regenerated** or changed
- Customers "own" their license key as a digital asset
- Lost keys can be retrieved anytime via customer portal

### **License-Email Relationship**
```
bzoumboulis@yahoo.co.uk ‚Üí POSPAL-M645-SMBE-MBPG-5L9Q (permanent)
```
- License tokens are cryptographically tied to email addresses
- Same customer can cancel/reactivate using the same license token
- Supports customer loyalty and reduces friction for returning customers

---

## üí≥ **Payment Policy: No Grace Period**

### **Immediate Enforcement Model**
```
Payment Success ‚Üí Status: 'active' ‚Üí Instant Access ‚úÖ
Payment Fails ‚Üí Status: 'inactive' ‚Üí Immediate Suspension ‚ùå
Payment Resumes ‚Üí Status: 'active' ‚Üí Instant Reactivation ‚úÖ
```

### **Key Rules**
- **No grace periods** - Payment failure = immediate suspension
- **No payment failure counting** - First failure triggers suspension
- **Binary access control** - Only `active` status grants access
- **Instant gratification** - Payment success = immediate access restoration

### **Customer Communication**
- Clear "pay-to-play" policy messaging
- Immediate suspension emails explain no-grace-period policy
- Reactivation emails celebrate instant access restoration
- Transparent billing - customers know exactly what to expect

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Database Schema (Cloudflare D1)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  unlock_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,          -- Permanent license key
  stripe_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  stripe_session_id TEXT,
  subscription_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  subscription_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' 
    CHECK (subscription_status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'cancelled')),
  payment_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0,          -- Not used in no-grace-period model
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Subscription Status States**
- **`active`**: Customer has valid subscription, full access
- **`inactive`**: Payment failed or overdue, access suspended
- **`cancelled`**: Customer cancelled, access suspended

### **License Validation Logic**
```javascript
function isSubscriptionActive(customer) {
  // Simple binary check - no grace periods or complex logic
  return customer.subscription_status === 'active';
}
```

---

## üîÑ **Payment Lifecycle Management**

### **Subscription Creation Flow**
1. Customer completes Stripe checkout
2. `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook fires
3. Customer record created with `status = 'active'`
4. Permanent license token generated and emailed
5. Customer can immediately use POSPal Pro

### **Payment Failure Flow**
1. Stripe payment fails (card declined, expired, etc.)
2. `invoice.payment_failed` webhook fires
3. Customer status immediately set to `inactive`
4. License validation fails instantly
5. Suspension email sent with clear policy explanation
6. Customer must update payment method to restore access

### **Payment Success/Reactivation Flow**
1. Customer updates payment method or payment succeeds
2. `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook fires
3. Customer status immediately set to `active`
4. License validation passes instantly
5. Welcome back email sent (if was previously inactive)
6. Immediate access to POSPal Pro features

### **Subscription Cancellation Flow**
1. Customer cancels via Stripe customer portal
2. `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook fires
3. Customer status set to `cancelled`
4. Access suspended at end of billing period
5. License token preserved for future reactivation
