### Stripe Test Payment Method Investigation & Documentation

**Issue Reported:**

**Investigation Results:**
- **Root Cause**: Expected behavior in Stripe test mode - test payment methods are ephemeral and don't persist in customer portal

### Customer Portal UX Enhancement & "pospaltest" Branding Fix

**Issues Identified & Resolved:**
- Fixed "pospaltest" branding issue in Stripe customer portal window
- Improved professional appearance and user experience of billing portal integration
- Repurposed custom portal HTML files as informational dashboards instead of conflicting billing systems

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- "pospaltest" naming originated from Stripe test account business profile settings
- Window branding and title were not properly customized for POSPal branding
- Custom portal files contained redundant billing functionality that could compromise security

**Frontend Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Window Branding** (`pospalCore.js:openCustomerPortal()`):
  - Changed window name from `'_blank'` to `'POSPalCustomerPortal'` for professional branding
  - Updated window properties with proper dimensions and removed unnecessary toolbars
  - Added professional messaging throughout the portal opening flow
- **Improved Loading States**:
  - Updated loading messages from "Stripe Customer Portal" to "POSPal Customer Portal"
  - Enhanced progress messages: "Connecting to POSPal Customer Portal..."
  - Better fallback handling for popup blockers with clear user guidance
- **Professional Messaging**:
  - Consistent POSPal branding in all toast messages and user communications
  - Added window title update attempt (limited by cross-origin restrictions)

**New Customer Dashboard** (`customer-dashboard.html`):
- **Informational Dashboard**: Shows subscription status, account info, and billing dates
- **Secure Architecture**: Directs all billing actions to Stripe portal (maintains PCI compliance)
- **Professional UI**: Modern design with proper POSPal branding and visual hierarchy
- **Educational Approach**: Explains why Stripe portal is used (security, compliance, trust)
- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions, support contact options, and security notices
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices with consistent experience

**Security & Compliance Maintained:**
- Kept Stripe's hosted portal for all financial transactions
- Avoided reimplementing payment processing in custom portal
- Added security notices explaining the secure integration approach
- Maintained PCI DSS compliance by not handling sensitive payment data

**Files Modified:**
- `pospalCore.js` - Enhanced `openCustomerPortal()` function with professional branding
- `customer-dashboard.html` - New informational dashboard (created)

**Configuration Required:**
- **Stripe Dashboard Update**: Change business name from "pospaltest" to "POSPal" in Stripe account settings
- **Business Profile**: Update logo and description for consistent professional branding

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ Professional "POSPal Customer Portal" branding instead of "pospaltest"
- ✅ Improved UX with better window handling and messaging
- ✅ Maintained industry-standard security by using Stripe's hosted portal
- ✅ Created informational dashboard for account overview without compromising security
- ✅ Clear separation between informational UI and secure billing operations

**Future Considerations:**
- Monitor Stripe business profile settings to ensure consistent branding

- Usage analytics dashboard could be added to informational portal
